# Netlify Configuration for Caravel
# Enables SPA routing for BrowserRouter with proper SEO handling

# Prerendered pages — serve static HTML directly (created by vite-plugin-seo-prerender)
# These files exist as /route/index.html in dist/ after build

# SPA fallback — known app routes get index.html (200)
# Netlify serves prerendered /route/index.html automatically for static routes
